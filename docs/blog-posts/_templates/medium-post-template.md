# [Clear, opinionated title that hints at a problem or outcome]

Write for Medium: short paragraphs, strong point of view, and a narrative flow.

- Prefer prose over lists.
- Use bullets only when you are making crisp distinctions (2–5 items).
- Avoid “template-y” placeholder headings in the final post.

---

## 1) [Meaningful hook section title]

Write 6–12 lines of narrative.
Open with a concrete pain or observation (support load, local dev friction, drift, developer fatigue).
Make it feel like you’re describing the reader’s week.

---

## 2) Why this matters

Set context without rambling. Keep this section short and readable.

Cover:

- what keeps showing up
- who feels it first (usually platform and support)
- why it gets worse as platforms scale

---

## 3) The situation most teams end up in

Describe the current reality in paragraphs.
If you use bullets here, keep them short and specific.

This is the “head nod” section.

---

## 4) Where things start to break

Call out 2–5 concrete failure modes.
Use subheadings and short paragraphs. Avoid long lists.

Be specific. Avoid abstract language.

---

## 5) The mistake we keep repeating

This is the opinionated section.
Name the wrong assumption, explain why it’s tempting, and describe the long-term cost.

This is often the most quoted section.

---

## 6) What “good” actually looks like

Paint a picture of the shape of “good”:

- not a tool pitch
- not a full solution
- principles and operating model

Focus on principles:
- Ownership
- Separation of concerns
- Observability
- Reuse

---

## 7) A more practical direction

Explain the direction you’re heading:
- Constraints
- Trade-offs
- Why this approach fits platform teams

Keep it grounded and realistic.

---

## 8) What’s next

Close strong:
- What you’ll cover in the next post
- A proof of concept you’re building
- What readers should look out for

End with momentum, not a summary dump.
